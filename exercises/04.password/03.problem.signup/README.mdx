	🦉 Our Remix routes are used to create both a client-side and a server-side
	bundle. Remix is pretty good at splitting those things up for us, but using
	modules that really should only be used on the server can potentially cause
	issues.
</callout-warning>

You can read all about
[Server vs. Client Code Execution](https://remix.run/docs/en/main/discussion/server-vs-client)
in the Remix docs if you like. We're going to take advantage of Remix's feature
to explicitly label a module as server-only by creating a file with `.server` in
the name.

We don't want `bcryptjs` to appear in the client at all (it requires `crypto`
anyway). 🐨 So please
create <InlineFile file="app/utils/auth.server.ts" /> and stick this in there:

```tsx
import bcrypt from 'bcryptjs'

export { bcrypt }
```

Then in the client build `auth.server.ts` will be an empty module so none of the
`bcryptjs` code or `crypto` code will be included in the client bundle.

👨‍💼 Great! Thanks Olivia! Now, let's create a password record when we create a
new user so that can be used when the user logs in.
Jump into <InlineFile file="app/routes/_auth+/signup.tsx" /> and follow the
emoji.

Once you've done that, head to <LinkToApp to="/signup" /> and try signing up a
new account. It should allow you to sign in and then you can check the database
for the password if you'd like to make sure it worked:

```sh nonumber
npx prisma studio
```
